# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## How to deploy

This deploys through github actions!

## How to use locally

- `npm install` (only initially needed)
- `npm start`

### Verify build before pushing remote

If there are any issues with wrong/outdated links, the github action will fail. To reduce the feedback loop, build it locally before pushing.

`npm run build`

## How to use the documentation repository

Mini guide for proceeding with documentation on [Catena-X Knowledge Agents](https://github.com/catenax-ng/product-knowledge)

- Documentation is written as a markdown file. Contributions are done via pull request
- We use [markdownlint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdownlint) in a pre-commit hook.

### How to configure markdown rules
