Welcome to Catena-X Knowledge Agents (aka Hey Catena!)

Catena-X Knowledge Agents is 
* an extension to the [Gaia-X](https://gaia-x.eu/)/[International Data Spaces](https://internationaldataspaces.org/) approach 
  * which allows Providers to offer Federated, But Sovereign computation *Services* instead of Plain Data Files
* a set of reusable UX Components 
  * which allow Consumers and Operators to script distributed peer-to-peer logics (we call them Inference *Skills*) instead of Ingesting and Transforming Tons of Raw Data
* a method for combining a set of Domain Ontologies into a Matchmaking Marketplace
  * which allows Consumers, Operators and Providers to form a close-to-optimal platform adopting to ad-hoc conditions and requirements.

Catena-X Knowledge Agents provides
* Blueprints for the most common provisioning and consuming scenarios
* Permissive and certified FOSS artifacts for a jumpstart implementing those blueprints.
* Consulting for domain-specific modelling and business building.
