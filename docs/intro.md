Welcome to the documentation of the Catena-X Knowledge Agents (aka Hey Catena!)

Catena-X Knowledge Agents is 
* an Extension to the Gaia-X/Dataspace Approach which allows Providers to Offer Federated, But Sovereign Inference Services instead of Plain Data Files
* a set of reusable UX Components which allow Consumers to Develop/Delegate Ready-Made Inference Skills instead of Ingesting Tons of Raw Data
* a way of combining a set of Domain Ontologies into a Matchmaking Marketplace.

Catena-X Knowledge Agents provides
* Blueprints for the most common provisioning and consuming scenarios
* Permissive and certified FOSS artifacts for a jumpstart implementing those blueprints.
* Consulting for domain-specific modelling and business building.

Catena-X Knowledge Agents was previously in a [spike](spike) phase (0.4.X)
Catena-X Knowledge Agents is currently in a [pilot](howto) phase (0.5.X)

It is planned to switch to the release phase (1.6.X) in Q4 2022
